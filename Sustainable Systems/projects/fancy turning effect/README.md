# RGBA Generator

Random RGBA Color Value Generator for CSS

### This project includes the following technologies:

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Project description:

This project was an early project I worked on as a way to not only build on my HTML, CSS and Javascript fundamentals, but to build a solution to a problem I was facing at the time.
The issue dealt with giving me a visual experience of different RGBA values without having to continually guess the values or think of a certain color, taking out the guess work I chose to randomise the values and incorporate the ability to copy the value if I felt that I liked the generated value without having to manually type it in.
I now know that this is easily achieved using dev tools within the console, but for an early solution to a problem I had, I'm very proud of the outcome of such a small project.

### What building this project taught me:

The project gave me further development of certain fundamentals and the capability to build a solution to an issue I had, I learnt that in order to copy values from an element, an input field is used. 
This project also gave me insight to ES6 Javascript through template literal strings and handling values and variable in and out of function scopes. 
Along with all this, it continued to build my HTML and CSS fundamentals.
